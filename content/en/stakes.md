* The rise of artificial intelligence is worrisome economically (as many jobs are devalued) and 
culturally (as the task of understanding our world is increasingly delegated to machines).

* To preserve human dignity, we must learn to discuss effectively about the behavior of computer systems

* Algorithms are too complex and change too rapidly for traditional means of debate

* Deliberations must be about source code, the only place where we can hope
to verify that computer systems do not harbor maliciuous intent

* To achieve this goal, we need a critical mass of people able to understand source code
