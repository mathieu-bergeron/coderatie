* Promote and defend coderacy (the ability to understand source code)

* When coderacy reaches a significant level, software will be very different 
    from what it is today

* The free software community already has a taste of this future: software and 
tools that are transparent, that respect privacy and that do not harbor tactics of
economic exploitation.

* But there's more: when using code to control a software tool, 
the possibilities for experimentation and creation explode.

* But there's even more: learning to program is the very best way to understand
how software works and to learn to formulate constructive criticism about new technologies.

* And finally, our dream: deliberation around source code will become a new way for citizens to defend their rights.
In term, we are dreaming of nothing less than the emergence of a new democratic space.
